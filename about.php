          <p>Phillip Jack Brooks (born October 26, 1978), better known by the ring name CM Punk, is an American mixed martial artist,
            comic book writer and former professional wrestler. He is currently signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC),
            where he competes in the welterweight division. He is perhaps best known for his time in WWE, where he is the sixth
            longest reigning WWE Champion of all-time. He was also recognized as the longest reigning heavyweight champion of the
            modern era, until Universal Champion Brock Lesnar broke that record in June of 2018. <br>

            Brooks began his professional wrestling career on the American independent circuit, primarily with Ring of Honor (ROH)
            until 2005, when he signed with the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He went on to become world champion throughout
            multiple organizations. Punk won the WWE Championship twice, WWE's World Heavyweight Championship three times and the ECW
            and ROH World Championships once each. In WWE, he was also a one-time World Tag Team Champion (with Kofi Kingston) and
            one-time Intercontinental Champion, making him the 19th Triple Crown Champion and the fastest man in WWE history to achieve
            this feat, doing so in 203 days. <br> In addition, he was the 2011 WWE Superstar of the Year and the first two-time Money in the
            Bank winner. During the peak of his career, Punk was considered by many as the best professional wrestler in the world.
            Pro Wrestling Illustrated named him Wrestler of the Year in both 2011 and 2012 during which he had one of the longest
            WWE Championship title reigns in history at 434 days. <br>

            Brooks used the CM Punk moniker his entire career in every organization he worked. Punk consistently portrayed the
            character of an outspoken, sharp-tongued, anti-establishment, straight edge iconoclast. Most of the straight edge
            principles he portrayed, such as not drinking alcohol or not taking recreational drugs, are his real life views.
            Depending on his alignment as a hero or villain, he emphasized different aspects of the straight edge culture to
            garner the desired audience reaction. <br>

            After becoming disgruntled in WWE, Punk retired from professional wrestling in 2014. He then pursued a career
            in mixed martial arts (MMA) and was signed by the UFC in December of that year. His first professional fight took
            place on September 10, 2016 at UFC 203 against Mickey Gall, where he was defeated via submission in the first round.
            His second professional bout took place on June 9, 2018 at UFC 225 against Mike Jackson, where he lost via unanimous decision</p>
