              <h2>Early career and IWA Mid-South (1999–2005)</h2>
              <p>Brooks' first venture into wrestling was a stint in a backyard wrestling federation called
                  the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s.
                  Brooks first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick
                  Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends,
                  Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion
                  started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his
                  brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged
                  and not have spoken since.</p>

              <p>Shortly before a TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a physical scuffle with Teddy Hart
                  outside of a restaurant that was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH
                  show in which Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury.
                  Around the time of the scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows,
                  leading to speculation he was fired for the incident.

              <p>At the September 1 (aired September 4) ECW taping, Punk defeated Morrison in a last chance
                  title match to win the ECW Championship. In the following months, Punk went on to have
                  successful title defenses against the likes of Elijah Burke (on September 16 at Unforgiven),
                  Big Daddy V via disqualification (on October 7 at No Mercy)[67] and The Miz (on October 28
                  at Cyber Sunday). On November 6, Punk retained the ECW Championship in a match against Morrison
                  following The Miz's interference. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Punk retained the title in a
                  triple threat match against The Miz and John Morrison. On January 22, 2008, Punk lost the ECW Championship
                  to Chavo Guerrero in a no disqualification match after Edge performed a spear on him, ending his reign at 143
                  days.</p>

              <p>On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his
                  booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser
                  agreed to leave the company.On September 13 at Breaking Point, Punk defeated The Undertaker
                  in a submission match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.Undertaker originally won
                  the match with his Hell's Gate submission hold, but SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long restarted
                  the match after stating that the ban that former SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero had placed
                  on the move was still in effect and Punk won the match with his Anaconda Vise when referee Scott Armstrong
                  and on October 25 at Bragging Rights in a fatal four-way match also involving Batista and Rey Mysterio.</p>

              <p>Embarrassed by being shaved bald as he considered himself always pure unlike his followers,
                  Punk began wearing a mask to hide his baldness. On June 20 at Fatal 4-Way,
                  Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio,
                  Big Show and the champion Jack Swagger, but he was unsuccessful when he was attacked by Kane,
                  who was accusing various people of attacking The Undertaker. On the July 16 episode of SmackDown,
                  Punk was finally unmasked by Big Show while healing from an arm injury. The following week on SmackDown,
                  Show also unmasked the anonymous member of The Straight Edge Society, who was revealed to be Joey Mercury.
